# BlazorCausalityDemo
Playing with linq between client and server for Blazor and console, for the fun!

To try this fast and easy, clone the project and set the startup projects to blazor.Server and blazor.Console in that order.

Then click on run without debug and the application will start a blazor variant and a consol app working with the same backend and a local sqlite database.
