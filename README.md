# BlazorCausalityDemo
Playing with linq, repositories, queryables and serialization between client and server for Blazor and Console, for the fun!

To try this fast and easy:

1. clone the project
2. Set the startup projects to blazor.Server and blazor.Console (in that order)
3. Then click on run without debug
4. The application will start a blazor variant and a consol app working with the same backend and a local sqlite database
5. Thats it!
